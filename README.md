# Live Location Tracker

This Flutter app tracks the user's location in real-time, provides geofencing functionality, and triggers notifications when the user enters or exits the defined geofence.

## Features

- **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Tracks the user’s GPS location and updates it continuously.
- **Geofencing**: Allows the user to set a geofence on the map. When the user enters or exits the geofence, a notification is triggered.
- **Customizable Radius**: Users can increase or decrease the geofence radius (e.g., 200m, 300m, 400m).
- **Notifications**: Local notifications are shown when the user enters or exits the geofence.
- **Map Rendering**: Uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) to display the user’s location and geofence.
